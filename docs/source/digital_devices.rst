Digital devices
=====

The digital devices are toxic and polluting object of our daily and we are going to see how to reduce their impact.
For this you need to follow the rules of the 5R:
- Refuse
- Reduce
- Reuse
- Return to earth
- Recycle

Refuse
----------------
If someone (a friend, your boy/girlfriend or a member of your family) want to offer to you the lastest fashionable smartphone you just need to refuse and explain that your actual is a really good one.

Reduce
----------------
Stop to buy useless thing to focus to the most important product for example you don't need wireless earphone that are not reparable.
If you absolutely have to buy a new device, try to at least turn to refurbished ones.

Reuse
----------------
And why your futur laptop or smartphone will not be the last but with a new screen and/or battery ? I promise you a lot of parts can be found online and tutorials to set them up on your phone exist.

Recycle
----------------
And, really, as a last resort, give it to competent services to recycle it. But first, extract the still reusable parts in order to use them to repair another defective one that you will buy second-hand online.
