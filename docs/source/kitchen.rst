Bottle of water
----------------
It's really common now to use now a stainless steel bottle instead of a regular plastic bottle, I think it's a better idea.
Personnaly, I prefer to use my cycling water bottle , but do as you want.

Food packaging
----------------
In order to reduce your waste, I advise you to buy them in bulk!

Sponge
----------------
To replace your classic sponge, you can use a tawashi sponge made from recycled material (many tutorials are available online). With it, you don't need to buy a new sponge, because it's reusable.
As soon as your tawashi is dirty, machine wash it between 30 and 60°C.
